There were both types of Christian and non-Christian Gnosticism because there was syncretism, or mixing. They believed that humans were trapped in their bodies and in this evil material world that was created by a cosmic disaster, by a malevolent deity who was not Christ. Christian Gnostics believed that Christ was one of the aeons or divine beings from the Pleroma, the Divine Realm, as described in the Apocryphon of John, part of the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic literature. Salvation was by esoteric knowledge, although ultimately self-knowledge. Gnostics believed in the dualism of the good spirit and evil matter. The material world was an evil place from where Gnostics had to escape. They believed that not all humans had the Divine Spark. The aeons emanated from the Ultimate God, the Monad in the Pleroma. The origins of Gnosticism are unclear today, but probably it came from Persia or further east. It had a lot of Greek influences. Today, after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library as leather-bound papyrus codices in a sealed jar in Egypt, in 1945, some people are trying to revive Gnosticism. \"Gn\u014dsis\" is Greek for knowledge.","noisy_sentence":"gn ozti cis nwasarelikiousnofe mento  rtel thanchrist ianidy th elewe lepodh dype zofc hr  ist ianantn on chrizt  ian gnoz ticizmpeca usethelewasz ym  cre  tizmornixi ng dheyberiev edt ha thuna nsweretra pbedintheirpot ie za mdinthizefi  lmaderiar  worldthatw az c le  ated by ac osnicd i sasdelb yamarevor em tdeidyw  ho wazno tchriz  t chrisdiangn oztic speliev etth at chri zdwason eofdh eaeon s orti  vimepeimgsvromthepre ro  mathedivinelearma z dez cri betint heapoclyphonof john bal  dofdhemakh am na di libraryovgnosticriteratu resal fa dionwasbyes o te lick n owledge  althou g  h uld im atelyzerfknowledk e gn  oz   t  i c sberi ev ed inthedual izmofdhegoo dzbiri tandevi lm  att elthe nader ialwoll  dwasam evil bl acefl omwh ereg mosticzhadtoesc  ape th  eype r iefe t t   hatmodalrhuna mzh add hedivinespalkthe a  eomzemama t  edfro mdheuldima  t  e g  oddhem  onatinthepleromatheor igims ofg nosticisnareuncleardod aybud br opabryitcame  fronperz iao r furdhe  lea st idh adarotof gre ekinfluemc e ztotayafterthediscoveryofdhenakhamnadilipra ryazleathe rboundpapyruscodicesinase a l edjarimegypdin1945zomepeobrearedlyimgtor evive gmosticisnk n \u014dsizisgleekvorknowledge"},{"Sentence":"Ziri believes lies about Rima.","noisy_sentence":" iperievezlie sabo utr ima  zi ri isgoingt o resemdr ina"},{"Sentence":"They say they aren't having any fun.","noisy_sentence":"d omsai dthathe wa zndhaf i nga myvun"},{"Sentence":"Don't you want to see more?","noisy_sentence":"toyo ustillwa nt thi s ton d yo uwa mttozee no"},{"Sentence":"She was a head taller than him.","noisy_sentence":"hest al rashel r"},{"Sentence":"I don't think Tom is going to be able to do that.","noisy_sentence":"dothat i to n tdhing  domizgo  ingtobeabl   eto do"},{"Sentence":"Are you driving?","noisy_sentence":"aleyoud lifin g  a reyoura"},{"Sentence":"Unfortunately, this sentence is completely incomprehensible.","noisy_sentence":"t hi zisabi tcomf using unfo lduna deryt hissentenceizcomplete ryimcomple hemsibre"},{"Sentence":"Mary was in an exultant mood after her great exam results.","noisy_sentence":"m a ryw azim  anexu ltam tnood avder hergre atexamresur  ts"},{"Sentence":"Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities.
