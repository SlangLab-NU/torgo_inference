"I remember as a child in the 1970s in the Philippines, there were many comics in Tagalog, of different genres. That phenomenon continues. Today, I enjoy particularly the wholly translated fantasy book The Explorers by Kirsten Nimwey into Tagalog. With machine translation greatly improving, maybe there will be many whole books translated by machine, with maybe some human editing and tinkering, in the coming decades. Machine translation is much better now than just ten or so years ago.

"Gnosticism was a religious movement older than Christianity. There were both types of Christian and non-Christian Gnosticism because there was syncretism, or mixing. They believed that humans were trapped in their bodies and in this evil material world that was created by a cosmic disaster, by a malevolent deity who was not Christ. Christian Gnostics believed that Christ was one of the aeons or divine beings from the Pleroma, the Divine Realm, as described in the Apocryphon of John, part of the Nag Hammadi Library of Gnostic literature. Salvation was by esoteric knowledge, although ultimately self-knowledge. Gnostics believed in the dualism of the good spirit and evil matter. The material world was an evil place from where Gnostics had to escape. They believed that not all humans had the Divine Spark. The aeons emanated from the Ultimate God, the Monad in the Pleroma. The origins of Gnosticism are unclear today, but probably it came from Persia or further east. It had a lot of Greek influences. Today, after the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library as leather-bound papyrus codices in a sealed jar in Egypt, in 1945, some people are trying to revive Gnosticism.

"Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.",owerovt hegl eatbankers whil   edheyw er ea ssumeddoha v  eitw asmu c hrezentet  putasthe khostzof nu mel oustyramdz   vr onju riuscaesart obenitomuss olimiwillt  es t ifypeoplealeveryhaldo  ndhosew  ho hav imghadpo wellozeid o laret e  stro ye ddhen ange ra tb astar r   oganceisjoine twi dh c o nd emptfordhebr esen tweagmezzdhe victi molh iscolbs eiznatetosufveralravailableintignities  itdlewztle ngthflomd henotzoyoumgbeo plew hobra v eddhe bi tdercolta ndscolch,te spideavl ad terinksu bp o sidiomto  dh econtlaly pe oblec o m ere adirytoternswithpowel the l eisl i tdrelea sonto dhi nk tha ttheb,imgh eattog no ck o ndo olzofperfe ctztra mgersan dfro mthem irr io n sova mericamswho folun teer etando rgami zetandblov e dtha tmorethandwo centuriesl ade rag o felnmendo fthepe obleb y dhepeopleantforthe peoprehaznotb erishetflo ndheearth

I took a long route going to the pizzeria, over the vast, whitened school field, which seemed like I was walking on a different moon or planet. I viewed the northern snowcapped bluish mountain range. At the pizzeria, I ate two slices and drank a black effervescent diet drink, whilst I was watching on the big screen the usual morning talk show The View before eleven o'clock. Whoopi Goldberg, who was the mystical black bartender character Guinan in the Star Trek franchise, co-hosted there. Today's guest was Marlee Matlin, a deaf American blonde actress, who knew American Sign Language. She looked like my high school French-language teacher Mrs. Lowry.
